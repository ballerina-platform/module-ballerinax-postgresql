## Introduction
This is the specification for the PostgreSQL standard library of [Ballerina language](https://ballerina.io/), which provides the functionality that is required to access and manipulate data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

The PostgreSQL library specification has evolved and may continue to evolve in the future. The released versions of the specification can be found under the relevant GitHub tag.

If you have any feedback or suggestions about the library, start a discussion via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues) or in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ballerinalang). Based on the outcome of the discussion, the specification and implementation can be updated. Community feedback is always welcome. Any accepted proposal, which affects the specification is stored under `/docs/proposals`. Proposals under discussion can be found with the label `type/proposal` in GitHub.

The conforming implementation of the specification is released to Ballerina central. Any deviation from the specification is considered a bug.

# 1. Overview

This specification elaborates on usage of PostgreSQL `Client` object to interface with an PostgreSQL database.

`Client` supports five database operations as follows,
1. Executes the query, which may return multiple results.
2. Executes the query, which is expected to return at most one row of the result.
3. Executes the SQL query. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
4. Executes the SQL query with multiple sets of parameters in a batch. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
5. Executes an SQL query, which calls a stored procedure. This can either return results or nil.

All the above operations make use of `sql:ParameterizedQuery` object, backtick surrounded string template to pass
SQL statements to the database. The `sql:ParameterizedQuery` supports passing of Ballerina basic types or typed SQL values
such as `sql:CharValue`, `sql:BigIntValue`, etc. to indicate parameter types in SQL statements.

# 2. Client

Each client represents a pool of connections to the database. The pool of connections is maintained throughout the
lifetime of the client.

**Initialisation of the Client:**
```ballerina
# Initializes the PostgreSQL client.
#
# + host - Hostname of the PostgreSQL server
# + user - If the PostgreSQL server is secured, the username
# + password - The password of the PostgreSQL server for the provided username
# + database - The name of the database. The default is to connect to a database with the
#              same name as the username
# + port - Port number of the PostgreSQL server
# + options - The database specific PostgreSQL connection properties
# + connectionPool - The `sql:ConnectionPool` object to be used within the database client. If there is no
#                    `connectionPool` provided, the global connection pool will be used
# + return - An `sql:Error` if the client creation fails
public isolated function init(string host = "localhost", string? username = "postgres", string? password = (), string? database = (),
            int port = 5432, Options? options = (), sql:ConnectionPool? connectionPool = ()) returns sql:Error?
```

**Configurations available for initializing the PostgreSQL client:**
* Connection properties:
  ```ballerina
  # Provides a set of additional configurations related to the PostgreSQL database connection.
  #
  # + ssl - SSL configurations to be used
  # + connectTimeout - Timeout (in seconds) to be used when connecting to the PostgreSQL server
  # + socketTimeout - Socket timeout (in seconds) to be used during the read/write operations with the PostgreSQL server
  #                   (0 means no socket timeout)
  # + loginTimeout - Timeout (in seconds) to be used when connecting to the PostgreSQL server and authentication (0 means no timeout)
  # + rowFetchSize - The number of rows to be fetched in one trip to the database
  # + cachedMetadataFieldsCount - The maximum number of fields to be cached per connection.
  #                               A value of 0 disables the cache
  # + cachedMetadataFieldSize - The maximum size (in megabytes) of fields to be cached per connection.
  #                             A value of 0 disables the cache
  # + preparedStatementThreshold - The number of `PreparedStatement` executions required before switching
  #                                over to use server-side prepared statements. A value of 0 disables the cache.
  # + preparedStatementCacheQueries - The number of queries that are cached in each connection
  #                                   A value of 0 for preparedStatementThreshold disables the cache.
  # + preparedStatementCacheSize - The maximum size (in mebibytes) of the prepared queries
  #                                  A value of 0 for preparedStatementThreshold disables the cache.
  # + cancelSignalTimeout - Time (in seconds) by which the cancel command is sent out of band over its own connection
  #                         so that the cancel message itself can get stuck. The default value is 10 seconds
  # + keepAliveTcpProbe - Enable or disable the TCP keep-alive probe
  # + binaryTransfer - Use the binary format for sending and receiving data if possible
  public type Options record {|
      SecureSocket ssl = {};
      decimal connectTimeout = 0;
      decimal socketTimeout = 0;
      decimal loginTimeout = 0;
      int rowFetchSize?;
      int cachedMetadataFieldsCount?;
      int cachedMetadataFieldSize?;
      int preparedStatementThreshold?;
      int preparedStatementCacheQueries?;
      int preparedStatementCacheSize?;
      decimal cancelSignalTimeout = 10;
      boolean keepAliveTcpProbe?;
      boolean binaryTransfer?;
  |};
  ``` 
* SSL Connection:
  ```
  # The SSL configurations to be used when connecting to the PostgreSQL server.
  #
  # + mode - The `SSLMode` to be used during the connection
  # + key - Keystore configuration of the client certificates
  # + rootcert - File name of the SSL root certificate. Defaults to the `defaultdir/root.crt`.
  #             in which the `defaultdir` is `${user.home}/.postgresql/` in Unix systems and
  #             `%appdata%/postgresql/` on Windows.
  public type SecureSocket record {|
      SSLMode mode = PREFER;
      string rootcert?;
      crypto:KeyStore|CertKey key?;
  |};

  # Represents the combination of the certificate, the private key, and the private key password if encrypted
  #
  # + certFile - A file containing the client certificate
  # + keyFile - A file containing the client private key
  # + keyPassword - Password of the private key if it is encrypted
  public type CertKey record {|
      string certFile;
      string keyFile;
      string keyPassword?;
  |};
  ```

## 2.1. Connection Pool Handling

Connection pool handling is generic and implemented through `sql` module. For more information, see the
[SQL Specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-sql/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md#21-connection-pool-handling)

## 2.2. Closing the Client

Once all the database operations are performed, the client can be closed by invoking the `close()`
operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients.

   ```ballerina
   # Closes the PostgreSQL client and shuts down the connection pool.
   #
    # + return - `()` or an `sql:Error`
   public isolated function close() returns Error?;
   ```

# 3. Queries and Values

All the generic `sql` queries and values are supported. For more information, see the
[SQL Specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-sql/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md#3-queries-and-values)

In addition to `sql` values, the `postgresql` package supports the following typed values for PostgreSQL data types,
1. `InetValue`
2. `CidrValue`
3. `MacAddrValue`
4. `MacAddr8Value`
5. `PointValue`
6. `LineValue`
7. `LineSegmentValue`
8. `BoxValue`
9. `PathValue`
10. `PolygonValue`
11. `CircleValue`
12. `UuidValue`
13. `TsVectorValue`
14. `TsQueryValue`
15. `JsonValue`
16. `JsonBinaryValue`
17. `JsonPathValue`
18. `IntervalValue`
19. `IntegerRangeValue`
20. `LongRangeValue`
21. `NumericRangeValue`
22. `TsRangeValue`
23. `TsTzRangeValue`
24. `DateRangeValue`
25. `PglsnValue`
26. `BitStringValue`
27. `VarBitStringValue`
28. `PGBitValue`
29. `MoneyValue`
30. `RegClassValue`
31. `RegConfigValue`
32. `RegDictionaryValue`
33. `RegNamespaceValue`
34. `RegOperValue`
35. `RegOperatorValue`
36. `RegProcValue`
37. `RegProcedureValue`
38. `RegRoleValue`
39. `RegTypeValue`
40. `PGXmlValue`
41. `CustomTypeValue`
42. `EnumValue`

All the above values are supported as typed `OutParameters` of the `call()` operation.

# 4. Database Operations

`Client` supports five database operations as follows,
1. Executes the query, which may return multiple results.
2. Executes the query, which is expected to return at most one row of the result.
3. Executes the SQL query. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
4. Executes the SQL query with multiple sets of parameters in a batch. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
5. Executes an SQL query, which calls a stored procedure. This can either return results or nil.
